How to Play
Press the start button to start, move the paddle left and right with W & D, use it to bounce the ball into the blocks to earn points. Once you run out of lives it's game over, and you must press replay to play again.

I never added any power ups, but I atleast added a way to randomly designate some blocks that would have had power ups, and gives them a little marker.
